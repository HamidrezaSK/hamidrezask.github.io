<p>I'm Mathias Meyer, software developer, consultant and coach from Berlin/Germany, and this is my weblog and personal site.</p> 
 
<p>I'm mainly working with Ruby on Rails these days and look back at over two years of experience and pleasure with it. I worked with Java in the area of J2EE/Spring/Hibernate. These days I'm mostly working with Java in the backend, using services like Solr or ActiveMQ.</p> 
 
<p>I'm doing end-to-end development of full projects, I'll add my knowledge and man-power to your team, and I coach your people in all things Ruby on Rails and AJAX. Automated testing is an important part of my development philosophy, so you won't get untested code from me. I can also help you with code audits and code reviews for your Ruby on Rails applications.</p>
