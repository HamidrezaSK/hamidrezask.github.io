I’m looking for a new role as CTO or VP Engineering, remote or in Berlin.

I consider myself an empathic leader with a servant and a growth mindset. I focus on people first, making sure they can do their best work.

I have a founder background of building up a company from scratch and bring understanding of all parts of the business, their value and how important it is to communicate and collaborate across functions.

My areas of interest:

* Engineering and company culture of collaboration, shipping, and quality
* Business and engineering strategy
* Collaboration across the entire business
* Mentoring and coaching of (engineering) managers and leads
* Inclusion and diversity
* People and processes
* High performance organisations
* Strong feedback loops across teams

My most recent work background:

* Founder (6 years) and CEO (4 years), grew team from 10 to 50, managing a team of teams, engineering teams, leadership team and departments
* (Infrastructure) engineer turned leader, manager and team builder
* Product- and business-focus with a technology angle
* Developer tooling, B2B, SaaS, enterprise software and sales

I’m looking to join a growth stage company (5-10+ MM ARR, or post Series A; 15+ people in engineering) that values diversity and inclusion, where technology is a key part of the business, and where I can help grow and scale the engineering teams to the next level.
