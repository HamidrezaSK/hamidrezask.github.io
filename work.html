    <p>I'm currently working for the Berlin-based company <a href="http://www.dawanda.com">DaWanda</a>, a marketplace for everything hand-made. Challenges so far included scaling, performance-tuning (application and database), setting up a full set of new servers, asynchronous messaging, setting up a test suite for and refactoring the code base, among other things.</p>

<p>I've worked on several Rails projects over the last two years, in both, the frontend and the backend areas. One of the publicly available project is <a href="http://www.omdb.org">OMDB</a>, an open media database, for now focused on offering independent information about movies, actors, etc.</p>

<p>Other projects are mostly for internal use. On these projects I was also responsible for deployment issues, PayPal integration, scheduling asynchronous tasks and managing the automated test environment.</p>

<p>After finishing my degree in computer science I worked a lot on projects using J2EE, mainly focused on Hibernate, Struts, Spring and JBoss. All used either Oracle 10g or IBM DB2 as a database. In the J2EE environment I've worked for several companies, including</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hannover-re.com">Hannover Re Insurance</a>: For their soon-to-launch intranet project I implemented the dynamic part based on the Portlet API and the Infopark Portal Manager Framework. The backend uses Spring for configuration, and for integration of existing web services, and Hibernate for persistence using Oracle 9i for storage.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jamba.de">Jamba GmbH</a>: I worked on the team which developed the Jamba community. I worked in both, backend and frontend areas, and was also responsible for deployment issues. The community was built with lightweight components, using Spring and Hibernate for the backend and Struts and Prototype/Scriptaculous for frontend work. I also coached the team on AJAX and the Prototype/Script.aculo.us libraries.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gedas.de">gedas Deutschland GmbH</a>: Their client Volkswagen needed an application to easily inventory loading units worldwide. The application was based on JBoss, Hibernate and Struts wired together with a custom framework, using DB2 for data storage.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.asdis.com">ASDIS Software AG</a>: Their Automated Configuration Management tool in facilitates Hibernate, JBoss, Struts and Quartz to manage and distribute software in heterogenous networks. I was responsible for backend development, deployment, the automated build and the database. I also lead the team as project manager for a while.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also work on smaller projects from time to time:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://thepapercraneproject.my-expressions.com">The Paper Crane Project</a>: Liz Shuman from Boston sent out 1000 cranes to people from all over the world. The project started on Flickr, and was based on the idea that people would send back photos and prints of the cranes in their new habitat. Together with <a href="http://www.beagoodgirl.net">Be A Good Girl</a> whose responsible for the design, I set up a photoblog on my-expressions.com and built the website and some client-side logic.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com">Bratwurst On Rails</a>: I wrote a small application to allow for registration for a <a href="http://www.paperplanes.de/archives/2007/6/15/announcing_bratwurst_on_rails/">pre-conference event</a> for the <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com">RailsConf Europe 2007</a> in Berlin. Design again by <a href="http://www.beagoodgirl.net">Be A Good Girl</a>, implementation by PAPERPLANES.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.astridhagen.no">Astrid Hagen</a>: Astrid Hagen is a journalist from Bergen, Norway. Together with <a href="http://www.beagoodgirl.net">Be A Good Girl</a> I implemented an archiving blog to present her past and recent work together with photos, since she's both an excellent journalist and photographer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cupcakeberlin.de">Cupcake Berlin</a>: Berlin's first Cupcake shop. Though the cupcake itself is not yet a common "snack" in Germany, the new website for Cupcake Berlin will help spread the word. Integrating Google Maps and a simple blogging system, it presents facts, news and the shop's menu. I highly recommend paying a visit. You won't regret it.</li>
</ul>
